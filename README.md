Hybrid CNN-SVM based Predictive hospital readmission model for Diabetes patients
We use a CNN model coupled SVM -based classifiers for readmission predictions. The planned research would use a 1999-2008 US diabetes dataset from 130 hospitals. This information was utilized to predict the chance of a 30-day readmission for a diabetic patient. Figure 1 displays the recommended model in its entirety.
